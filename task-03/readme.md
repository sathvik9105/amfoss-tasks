#### [task-03] (https://github.com/sathvik9105/amfoss-tasks/tree/main/task-03): Hello, World!

- I was able to code in python, c, c++, java, js, ruby, rust programming languages.
- Unfortunately, I could not solve the question in Elixer, Go and Haskel languages as I'm not familiar with the basics and I didn't want to copy paste codes.
- I'm done with dsa in python so I could solve the question in python programming language. 
- I'm some what familiar with C and C++ as I have done courses on these in my secondary schooling.
- I have java course in this semester so got to learn the basics, syntax and stuff.
- For javascript, ruby and rust I learnt the basics from codechef platform. I got to know about the syntax. Initially I struggled in defining variables and got wrong outputs when I had run the codes in Vs Code, but later on I browsed the internet, understood my mistakes and learnt from them. (Resource: Geeks for Geeks, Codechef, freecodecamp.org)
- For coding in python language, I used google colab and for rest of the languages, I coded in Vs Code by installing the extesions.
