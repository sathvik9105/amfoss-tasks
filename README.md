# amfoss-tasks

### Intro:
Hello club members! I'm Sathvik Pasuvula, pursuing b.tech in Computer Science & Engineering (entering S2 of freshmen year) from Amrita Viswa Vidyapeetham. I hail from Hyderabad - the city of pearls. I come from a small family which include my father, mother and a younger brother. My hobbies are listing to pop music and watching late night series. Currently, my short term goal is to be selected in the amFOSS club. Really excited for taking up the challenges as I'd learn lot of new stuff and interact with club members and my mentors.


### Why should I be chosen for this club?
Coding has always been my passion. I've known to code for a while and also familiar with computer hardware essentials. I believe technology can make human lives much more comfortable and easier.  I like to solve real life problems which are ofcourse challenging as it makes me to think deeper and find solutions using technology. I'm always curious to learn new technologies and apply the concepts to solve real life problems. What drives me even more is the need to learn how something or anything works. I'm a quick learner, having a good grasping power. I can also manage team members and work efficiently for the club. I'm also good in marketing and PR, can manage the social media handles and help the club reach to more peaple. I also respect time and money as these two are the main driving factors for any human being. I'm very confident that FOSS club would benefit by recruiting me. I ensure that I won't be a burden to the club and adhere to all the norms of the club. I'm looking forward to learn and explore fields like big data, data analysis, deep learning, machine learning, neural networks in data science and generative AI. I also expect that I'd grow better and better in day to day life through the FOSS club.


### My goals for the upcoming months:
(1) Get a command in programming languages like python and c through college and may be though FOSS if I were selected. (2) Learning html, css, js for web development. I'm actually good at designing so I look forwaerd to learn front end development. I'd look for quality online courses for learning and may be I could learn through FOSS. (3) Learn Data Science related concepts such as machine learing, data analytics, dbms, deep learning through my online degree as I mentioned before. (4) I'd look forward to learn about content writing and to have a good command in techinal communication.


### How would I contribute back to FOSS club?
I feel very happy to serve the club in which ever way it wants. I'd help the members in organising events, make everyone feel comfortable while in work mode. I will do my maximum and to the best of my abilities to aid and help the club and its members with anything. I'd also help the club grow in terms of reputation and popularity as I feel I'm good at PR and marketing. I'd also ensure that no property of the club would be damaged or misused in my presence. I'd also help in getting funds or donations if needed by connecting with industry related people.
