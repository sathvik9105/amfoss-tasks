# TERMINAL WIZARD TASK COMPLETED.

This being the first 'actual' task has been challenging as I had to learn about git and github, a completely new learning experience. I've got to know about the woriking of various git cmds and terminal cmds through youtube videos and whenever I got stuck with a problem, I took the help of chatgpt and found out the solutions for them all by myslef. This gave me a great and new learning experience.
