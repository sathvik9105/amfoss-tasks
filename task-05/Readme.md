<hr>

- This task was quite challenging as I had to replicate a webpage using html and css. Most of the task was done right and there are a few minor mistakes I found which couldn't be rectified.  

- Also, I could not follow the D.R.Y rule as I'm not perfect with creating reusable html components.
  
- I've developed the website according to ubuntu os google browser, I'm encountering issues with the aspect ratio in different os/browsers.  Kindly ignore and verify my site in ubuntu google 
  browser.
  
- I've used netlify website hosting service as I feel this is the easiest and most convenient way of hosting a website.
