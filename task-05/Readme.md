<hr>
- This was a challenging task as I had to replicate a webpage using html and css.
<br>
- However, I could not follow the D.R.Y rule as I'm not perfect with creating reusable html components.
<br>
- I've developed the website according to ubuntu os google browser, I'm encountering issues with the aspect ratio in different os/browsers.  Kindly ignore and verify my site in ubuntu google 
  browser.
<br>
- I've used netlify website hosting service as I feel this is the easiest and most convenient way of hosting a website.
