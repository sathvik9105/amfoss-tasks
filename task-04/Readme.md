- This task 'was and is' the most challenging task (still trying to solve remaining levels ðŸ˜…). I'm familar with HackerRank platform and this has become a habit of picking up random questions from HackerRank and solving in python and java programming languages. However the Cp-Praveshan contest has a brilliant bunch of questions to do and it some what motivated me push my limits more towards competitive programming. It felt like solving real life problems.
  
- I could solve the following challenges of the contest:
    - Challenge-1: Gridlock Showdown
    - Challenge-2: Ethereal Quest
    - Challenge-6: Adventure in Aetheria
    - Challenge-7: Unveiling the Character Deviation
    - Challenge-8: Lost in Translation
- But I couldn't solve Chalenges-3,4,5,9,10. Although I understood the questions and details, yet I couldn't build the logic for these challenges. Even after commiting and submiting this task in github, I'm still trying to solve these on my own and may crack these soon.

  - Resources: No help seeked from external resources as the task was only to code and solve the questions. I've used python programming language to solve the challenges.
