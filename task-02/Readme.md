### - I'm really thankful to amfoss club for making me create my first porstfolio site. I thoroughly enjoyed this task as it was fun in building the portfolio site using a hugo theme and hosting it in github pages. I've mentioned the process and steps that I followed in the blog post. All the links are mentioned above :)
