# Task-08 Poke-Search completed üõ†Ô∏è

- This was the most interesting task but time consuming (for me).
- Initially I had issues with package installation, but later on (after sumiting repo to amfoss), I got the issue fixed and started to work on this immediately.
- I've thoroughly gone through the instructions mentioned in the readme of task repo and thoroughly implemented them.
- Fetching the pokemon data from PokeApi was easy as I'm familiar with the API data fetching (through task-07 weather extension).
- I've made minutes changes to the pokedex apart from the task requiremnets (especially stylling-to make it look attractive). I could do so as I'm familiar with css (used stylesheets).
- Unfortuanely I'm unable to upload the whole Poke-Search folder (includes pycache and env files) as the folder consists around 9000 files and tried multiple times uploading the folder to the github repo. I've also tried replit service but facing the same issue. I've also tried to zip the folder and push it to github repo but the folder couldn't be opened in github repo (don't know the exact reason).
- So, I've uploaded only main.py, search.py(Qt) and captured_pokemons directory (as zip folder). Also I've uploaded a screen recording of my pokedex working. Please download the raw file and review it.
